\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Although modern web applications settle for eventual consistency in
return for high availability, they nonetheless need stronger
consistency guarantees to support small, yet significant, fraction of
their functionality. The de facto interfaces exposed by well-known
eventually consistent data stores are often ill-specified and too
low-level from the perspective of an application developer. There
currently exists a wide chasm between the high-level
application-specific consistency requirements, and low-level
store-specific tunable consistency levels. This paper describes \name,
a programming framework and a system that proposes to address this gap
by lifting and standardizing the interface to an eventually consistent
data store.  We present many examples that demonstrate the advantage
of reasoning with high-level interface exposed by \name, when compared
to the low-level interfaces offered by off-the-shelf data stores. We
realize an instantiation of \name on top of Cassandra, and illustrate
the performance implications of using \name, for both, applications
and data stores.
